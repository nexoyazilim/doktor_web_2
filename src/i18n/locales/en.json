    "approach": "My Aesthetic Surgery Approach",
    "approachDescription": "Aesthetic surgery is not just physical change, but also an art that increases a person's self-confidence and improves their quality of life. Over my 20+ years of experience, I have aimed to achieve natural and harmonious results by considering each patient's unique anatomical structure and aesthetic expectations.",
    "approachDescription2": "In addition to modern surgical techniques, I also prefer minimal invasive approaches, enabling my patients to experience a faster recovery process. I provide services across a wide range from nose aesthetics to breast surgery, from facial rejuvenation to body contouring.",
    "approachDescription3": "By conducting detailed consultations before each operation, I understand my patients' expectations and inform them about realistic results. My goal is not only to look beautiful, but also to achieve healthy and functional results.",
    "patientApproach": "My Patient-Centered Approach",
    "patientApproachDescription": "The communication I establish with my patients is the most important part of the treatment process. Treatment plans specially designed for each patient are not limited to surgical techniques alone. Pre-operative psychological preparation, post-operative care and follow-up processes are also integral parts of this plan.",
    "patientApproachDescription2": "From the first consultation, I focus on understanding my patients' expectations and concerns. Each patient has a different story, different expectations and different concerns. Therefore, instead of a standard approach, I prepare a customized treatment plan for each patient.",
    "patientApproachDescription3": "Safety and quality form the foundation of my working principles. Together with international sterilization standards, modern operating room conditions and my experienced team, I provide the safest environment. The post-operative follow-up process is as important as the operation itself.",
